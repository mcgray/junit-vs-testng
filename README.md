Junit vs TestNG
===============

A couple of example for my talk about [JUnit](http://junit.org) vs [TestNG](http://testng.org)

There is no Maven/Gradle build files or IDE projects files in the repo. In order to compile and run the tests you should add the dependencies to JUnit and TestNG by yourself in a preferred way.

The main topics described in this particular snippets are:

1. Test suites
2. Test groups
3. Parametrized tests
4. Exception testing
5. JUnit Rules
